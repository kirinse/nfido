XMB 1.9.11+ Translation System Tips

Starting with XMB version 1.9.11, files named *.lang.php
are no longer saved in the /lang/ subdirectory.  Only the English
source file is used as a failsafe.

Visit the Administration Panel of your board to upload the new files.

From your admin panel, click Translations.

Scroll to the bottom of the options to find "Install New Language."

Note: If you are doing an upgrade from any version less than 1.9.8
then the upgrade script will need to use the language files one last time.
Do use the new English.lang.php file because it is saved during the upgrade.
